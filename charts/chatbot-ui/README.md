Introducing Chatbot UI - your user-friendly access to OpenAI's ChatGPT. This open-source tool reimagines ChatGPT's interface with practical features like New Chat, Import/Export Data, and Settings.

Quickly link up with OpenAI's API using your API key - a seamless connection at your fingertips. Remember, Chatbot UI isn't OpenAI-affiliated, it's simply a dynamic alternative to their standard UI.

This tool bridges your communication with OpenAI's API, requiring an API key to function. We recommend setting up your OpenAI API key in the sidebar's bottom left for smooth integration.

Enjoy the New Prompt feature, enabling fresh data entry. Chatbot UI caters to those seeking an efficient, user-friendly way to employ OpenAI's API.

> Note: Chatbot UI is entirely independent from OpenAI.

To use Chatbot UI, you'll need your OpenAI API Key. Find your key on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) - ensure its privacy.
