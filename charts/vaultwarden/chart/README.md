# Vaultwarden

Vaultwarden is a lightweight, self-hosted password manager that serves as an alternative to Bitwarden. It provides a secure, private way to manage and store your passwords, notes, and other sensitive information. Vaultwarden is compatible with the Bitwarden ecosystem, allowing you to use official Bitwarden clients, extensions, and mobile apps while maintaining full control of your data on your own server.

## Summary

Vaultwarden is designed to be a lean, resource-efficient solution for self-hosted password management. Unlike other solutions, Vaultwarden is written in Rust and runs on a variety of platforms with minimal resource usage. By hosting Vaultwarden yourself, you gain complete control over your data without sacrificing compatibility with the Bitwarden client applications.
