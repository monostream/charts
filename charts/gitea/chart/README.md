Gitea is a vibrant, open-source, self-hosted Git service that serves as an appealing alternative to platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Developed in the powerful and efficient Go language by a team of passionate independent developers, Gitea came into existence in 2016 as a community-driven fork of Gogs, another lightweight Git service.

The birth of Gitea was fueled by the desire for a more collaborative, open development process. The objective was to shape a service that's not just maintainable and easier to use, but also more secure than its predecessor, Gogs.
